INGOPCS OPC UA stack
====================

This project contains the following elements:
- src/ingopcs: source files of the INGOPCS project OPC UA stack (client side only)
- test/ingopcs: unit tests on the stack
- stub_client: define a client side simple use case of the stack (to be runned faced to an equivalent stub server)
- cert: certificates and keys as client / server using an internal CA
- Makefile*: makefile compiling internal tests and stack code (not as a library)
- build: compiled files during make execution
- out: built internal tests executables, certificates and keys necessary for execution

Compilation (Linux, tested under Ubuntu 14.04):
- Pre-requesite: gcc, make
- To compile the stack as a simple client use case, and unit tests: execute the "make" command
Documentation generation:
- Pre-requesite: doxygen
- To generate the documentation: execute the "make doc" command
- Documentation generated in apidoc/ and explored with a web-browser from file apidoc/html/index.html

To run the tests of the stack (unit test and client/server simple use case):
- Compile the stack and tests
- Copy stub_server executable (compiled with OPC Foundation Ansi-C stack) into out/ directory
- Execute the test-all.sh script
- Check results in out/*.tap files
