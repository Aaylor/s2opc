INGOPCS OPC UA stack
====================

This project contains the following elements:
- src/: source files of the INGOPCS project OPC UA stack (client side
  only)
- lib/mbedtls-2.3.0: source files of mbedtls cryptographic library
- test/ingopcs: unit tests on the stack
- stub_client: define a client side simple use case of the stack (to
  be runned faced to an equivalent stub server)
- cert: certificates and keys as client / server using an internal CA
- Makefile*: makefile compiling internal tests and stack code (not as
  a library)
- build: compiled files during make execution
- build_platform: platform dependant compiled files during make
  execution
- out: built internal tests executables, certificates and keys
  necessary for execution
- apidoc/html: generated code documentation in HTML format

- The mbedtls library is also distributed under the Apache 2.0 license

Compilation (Linux, tested under Ubuntu 14.04):
- Pre-requesites: 
  * gcc (tested with GCC version >= 4.8.4)
  * make (tested with GNU Make version >= 3.81)
  * Check library (https://libcheck.github.io/check/)
- To compile the stack as a simple client use case, and unit tests:
  execute the "make" command

Documentation generation:
- Pre-requesite: doxygen
- To generate the documentation: execute the "make doc" command
- Documentation generated in apidoc/ and explored with a web-browser
  from file apidoc/html/index.html

To run the unit tests of the stack:
- Compile the stack and tests
- Execute the test-all.sh script
- Check results in out/results.tap files

Tests are covering the following cases:
- Unit tests: cryptographic library and tools used by the stack
