INGOPCS OPC UA communication Stack and Toolkit
==============================================

This project provides a C source code implementation of the OPC UA
communication stack, B model and C source code implementation of a
minimal OPC UA Toolkit and a cryptographic library.

Those elements are provided in the following directories:
- Stack: the OPC UA Stack source code, unit tests and example tests
- Toolkit: the OPC UA Toolkit model, source code and example tests
- libraries: the cryptographic libraries provided (only mbedtls)

INGOPCS OPC UA Stack features
=============================
- Client side:
  * Opens a TCP UA connection: sends HELLO and handles ACK reply,
  * Opens a Secure Channel: sends a OpenSecureChanel (OPN) request,
    handles response from server,
  * Security modes: None, Sign or SignAndEncrypt,
  * Sends request messages for the OPC UA services, accepts responses,
    decrypts them, and transmit them to the application,
  * Wrappers (binary compatibility) for foundation OPC UA foundation
    Stack API (no wrapper for encryption services used inside the stack).

- Service side:
  * Open a TCP UA listener: wait for TCP connection, then handles
    HELLO and sends ACK reply,
  * Opens a Secure Channel: check received OpenSecureChanel (OPN)
    request and sends OPN response,
  * Security modes: None, Sign or SignAndEncrypt,
  * Check reception of OPC UA services requests and trigger the
    application configured service treatment and response sending,
  * Wrappers (binary compatibility) for foundation OPC UA foundation
    Stack API (no wrapper for encryption services used inside the stack).

- Available security policy (encryption schemes):
  * http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#None,
  * http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#Basic256,
  * http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#Basic256Sha256.

INGOPCS OPC UA Toolkit features
===============================
- Client side:
  * Create a session with an anonymous user
  * Send a request through the created session

- Server side:
 * Static address space defined
 * Accepts creation of a session with an anonymous user
 * Read service

- Common features:
  * Static configuration of a unique endpoint to open or connect to
  * Security policy and mode can be used with None only


INGOPCS OPC UA Stack and Toolkit tests
======================================
Compilation (Linux, tested under Ubuntu 14.04):
- Pre-requesites: 
  * gcc (tested with GCC version >= 4.8.4)
  * make (tested with GNU Make version >= 3.81)
  * Check library (https://libcheck.github.io/check/ version >= 0.10.0)
- To compile the INGOPCS OPC UA Stack static library and INGOPCS OPC
  UA Toolkit: execute the "make" command
- To run the INGOPCS OPC UA Stack and INGOPCS OPC UA Toolkit tests:
  execute the test-all.sh script: "./test-all.sh LOCAL"
- Tests results are provided in stack/out/*.tap and toolkit/out/*.tap files
